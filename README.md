## Notes

Working around android studio IDE was a bit challenging as the environment was pretty new for me. I have previous experience with Java so that eased the process
a little bit, but wrapping my head around the use of multiple android libraries, clicklisteners, etc. was challenging at first. I also struggled *a lot* with setting up
android emulator as my PC has an AMD processor, which caused some technical issues, all of which are resolved by now.
